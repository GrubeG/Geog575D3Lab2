                <h1>European Union Environmental Issues</h1>
                    
                <p id="Welcome"> One of the more difficult problems the world faces when trying to combat Climate Change is that fact that climate issues are a not just a local issue. Even with global goals like those set out in the Paris Agreement in 2016, countries ultimately are in charge of enforcing those rules. Europe is a great example of how individual countries' decisions can ultimately have an effect on those around them because of the small size and connectedness of the countries. The map and graph below show how the European Union counties have fared in combating a series of environmental issues.

          <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
          <p class="lead">For this analysis, the focus is mainly on data on a per capita basis, with the exception of air quality. Countries with a larger population will naturally have higher levels of waste and energy use, so the intention is to look at how each county is managing environmental issues despite population differences. Air Quality is an average across each country and less easily measured per capita. Below are some explanations on why countries fair better or worse in certain categories. Helpful background information was provided by Eurostat's Statistics Explained guides, linked in the other sources section.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Greenhouse Gases - Overall, the countries that fare best are in southern Europe, with the more industrialized countries in central and northern Europe producing larger amounts. Luxembourg is a notable  outlier, which may be due to its dense population and large number of vehicles within the country.</li>
              
            <li>Total Waste - The locations the produce the most waste are those that are heavily in the mining industry, (such as Sweden, Finland, Bulgaria and Romania) construction (Luxembourg) or oil shale production (Estonia).</li>
              
            <li>Non-Renewable Energy - The countries that fair worst in this category tend to be highly reliant on one source for their energy, such as peat (Finland), oil shale (Estonia), coal (Czechia) or natural gas/oil (Netherlands and Belgium. On the other hand, Croatia, Latvia Austria and Romania utilize hydroelectric power at high rates, while Lithuania uses large amounts of biomass and wind power. </li>
              
            <li>Freshwater Extractions - Estonia's intensive oil shale industry requires a lot of water for cooling purposes, so it is far and away number one on this list. Greece, Italy and Spain all use lots of water for agriculture and irrigation because of their Mediterranean climates. Bulgaria's high water usage is partially due to losses due to aging infrastructure on their public water system.</li>
            
            <li>Air Quality - Bulgaria and Poland have the worst air quality, largely attributed to their dependence on coal power in home heating. In fact, most issues are in eastern and central Europe where heating and older industrial plants dating back to the Soviet area are still having an impact on air pollution. Finland and Sweden, on the other hand, have some of the cleanest air in the world, largely due to isolation from heavy industry and cleaner burning vehicles.</li>

          <p class="lead">Looking at each of the five variables presented above, it is possible to create a ranking of which country fares best, while acknowledging that there are many other variables not included here that certainly factor in.</p>
